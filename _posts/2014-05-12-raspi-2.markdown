In a previous post I've shown how a Raspberry Pi can acquire data from
a BMV-60x battery monitor, thus being kept aware of a boat's batteries
state. In this post, I'll extend the system to monitor the boat's
solar panels.

Purpose (besides fun)
---------------------

The boat has a mix of energy sources: a shore plug, a 5kW fuel
generator, and solar panels. It also has a set of batteries, so that
electricity can be used when needed, rather than when produced. The
BMV indicates what globally goes in or out of the batteries, but can't
tell how much comes from which source. For instance, if the BMV
indicates -250W, the're no way to tell whether we're using 250W by
night, or whether the panels produce 750W while we're using 1000W.

My objective here will be to gather data in parallel from the MPPT
(Maximum Power Point Tracker, i.e. the interface between the solar
panels and the batteries) and the battery monitor.


Hardware & Wiring
-----------------

The [MPPT]() uses a 3.3V UART, just as the BMV. The problem is, it's
10m away from the BMV and the Raspberry:

_Aft of the boat, with the positions of the Raspberry and the
MPPT. For scale, the boat is 5m wide._

Besides, the Raspberry has only one UART, and it's taken. So the
solution is to add a 10m USB extender (with a signal repeater at the
end, as required for lengths >5m) and an UART/USB adapter. I'll also
throw a USB hub in, as the inverter is just nearby the MPPT and I'll
eventually wan to connect with it.

Adapting the software
---------------------

Further Improvements
--------------------

Besides keeping a history and instant view on our solar production and
battery usage, several improvements can be made:

* coupled with GPS (and ideally orientation) data, we can figure out a
  map of the solar-friendly places on the canal.

* when we're connected to the shore, and the panels produce some
  electricity yet not enough for our needs, we currently leave the
  panels unused: the batteries are and remain full, we just use the
  shore power. If we wanted to use solar power, we'd have to switch on
  batteries when they're over, say, 90% full, and reenable shore
  intake when they get below 75%. We're not going to do that manually,
  but if the Raspberry gets control over the inverter, we can let it
  handle that for us automatically, and with more refinments:

  * switch the shore up when a water heater starts;

  * limit shore intake so that we stay in the 75%-90% interval for as
    long as possible;

  * make sure the batteries are topped up once a week as it's better
    for their health; etc.
